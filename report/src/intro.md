# UCBoulder Big Data final project

This report documents the design, development and deployment of a
complete web application.
The application collects data from a public API, transforms the data
(using a text to speech algorithm), and presents this data to users over
the Internet in the form of a website or through a REST API as a JSON
document.

The application provides an audio version of recent research papers.
It watches for new research papers on [https://arxiv.org/](https://arxiv.org/),
generates audio of the summary of the paper, and then stores the information
about the paper and the generated audio version.
This data is accessible using a public website at the following URL.
